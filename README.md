# JBMinigamesAPI
Counter-Strike 1.6 Jailbreak VoteCT Minigames API built for FxP-CS Community

This is an old CS1.6 Jailbreak VoteCT Minigames API i wrote many years ago (maybe 2017 or 2018) and i found it on my Google Drive backup
It is built under AMXX version 1.8.2 and i never updated it since then. If you wish you can update it by yourself.
i'm not supporting any changes and will not give any help, use it as is

Some minigames already included
1. Jailbreak FirstWrites Contest
2. Jailbreak Guess the number Contest
3. Random Player

You can build more games as you like.
The plugin already contain a menu with votes all you need is to register new games and it will appear in the menu


My old nickname is Just0ne AKA Angryx so maybe you'll find that name in the plugin.
