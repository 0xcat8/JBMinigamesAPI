# JBMinigamesAPI
Counter-Strike 1.6 Jailbreak VoteCT Minigames API built for FxP-CS Community

This is an old CS1.6 Jailbreak VoteCT Minigames API i wrote many years ago (maybe 2017 or 2018) and i found it on my Google Drive backup
It is built under AMXX version 1.8.2 and i never updated it since then. If you wish you can update it by yourself.
i'm not supporting any changes and will not give any help, use it as is
